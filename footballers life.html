                            Kerr was born in East Fremantle, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. She is the daughter of Roxanne (née Regan) and Roger Kerr. Her father, a professional Australian rules football player, was born in Calcutta to an English father (a featherweight boxer) and an Indian mother who played basketball.[26] Her mother also comes from a sporting family: her father Harry and uncle Con Regan were professional footballers in the West Australian Football League and another uncle J. J. Miller was a champion jockey who won the Melbourne Cup in 1966 with Galilee.[26]
                            
                            I started at 12. Before that it was all AFL. I hated soccer when I was a kid. I never had a soccer ball around the house.
                            
                            Sam Kerr[27]
                            Kerr played Australian rules football when she was young. Both her father and older brother, Daniel Kerr, were professional Australian rules footballers.[28][29] She played the sport until switching to association football at the age of 12, mostly due to gender restrictions.[30][31]
                            
                            Despite facing some struggles transitioning from Australian rules football to association football,[32] at age 13, she was spotted by Perth Glory striker Bobby Despotovski who described her athleticism and raw talent as "exceptional".[33] At age 15, she made her W-League and international debuts.[34]

                            Western Knights, 2006–2008
                            Kerr first started playing football as a junior at Western Knights in Mosman Park. After three years at the Western Knights, she trialled for the Western Australian State Team before moving to Perth Glory.[27]

                            Kerr playing for Perth Glory, 2010
                            Kerr made her debut for Perth Glory at the age of 15 during the 2009 W-League season. She was voted Players' Player at the 2009 W-League Awards and awarded Goal of the Year for her long–range goal against Sydney FC in round 8.[35][36] During the 2010–11 season, Kerr started in all 10 matches and scored three goals.[5] She scored a brace in the first half of a match against Adelaide United on 14 January 2011 lifting Perth to a 2–1 victory.[37]
                            
                            Western New York Flash, 2013–2014
                            In 2013, Kerr signed with the Western New York Flash. She made 19 starts in her 21 appearances for the club and scored six goals.[5] After defeating Sky Blue FC 2–0 in the semi-finals,[38] the Flash lost 2–0 to Portland in the final.[39]
                            
                            Kerr returned to the Flash for the 2014 season. Head coach Aaran Lines said of Kerr, "With her attributes – her speed, athleticism and instincts – if she continues to develop at the rate she is, Sam can become one of the best strikers in the world."[40] Kerr started in all 20 matches and was the team's leading scorer with 9 goals.[5] She was named NWSL Player of the Week for week 9 after recording a brace and assist against Portland.[41] Following the 2014 season, Kerr was traded to Sky Blue FC in exchange for Elizabeth Eddy and a first-round pick—fourth overall—in the 2015 NWSL College Draft.[42][43] The Flash used that pick to draft Sam Mewis.[44]
                            
                            Return to Perth Glory, 2014–2015
                            In August 2014, Kerr returned to Perth Glory on a one-year deal as one of six Matildas to sign for Perth.[45] She would open her account in Perth's second match against Adelaide United to give Perth the lead in the second half which they would win.[46] The following match she scored a double in her team's 10–1 rout of Western Sydney Wanderers.[47] After missing out in the next four games, Kerr would go and score eight goals in the final four games of the regular season which included a hat-trick against her former team in Sydney FC.[48]
                            
                            She continued her regular season form in the following season when she scored the winning goal in a 2–1 victory over Melbourne Victory in the opening round of the competition.[49] That would be the only goal that she would score in the season with her leg giving way in a non-contact ankle injury which forced her out for the rest of the season.[50] This wouldn't stop Perth from giving her a one-year contract extension before the start of that season.[51] In the 2016–17 W-League season she scored ten goals, led the team to the Grand Final, and earned the Julie Dolan Medal and the Penny Tanner Media MVP Award.[52] In October 2018, she became the first marquee player of the W-League when she was reportedly offered $400,000 contract to stay in Perth instead of going overseas where she was offered $100,000 less.[53][54] The marquee signing delivered in the 2018–19 W-League season, when she finished top of the goal scoring charts with 17 goals at above a goal a game. This included a hat-trick in the semi-final against Melbourne Victory which booked Perth's spot into the grand final.[55][56]
                            
                            Sky Blue FC, 2015–2017
                            In 2015, Kerr joined Matildas teammate Caitlin Foord at Sky Blue FC following their participation at the FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada.[57][58] Kerr's six goals in her nine appearances ranked first on the team.[5]
                            
                            During the 2016 season, Kerr made nine appearances for Sky Blue after being away with the national team in preparation for the 2016 Rio Olympics. She scored five goals during the regular season.[5] Kerr was named NWSL Player of the week for Week 18 after scoring two goals: an 80th-minute equaliser against the Orlando Pride and a game-winning goal against the Pride a few days later.[59]
                            
                            In the 2017 season, Kerr set a new NWSL record when she scored 4 goals in a single game after being down 3–0 to Seattle Reign at halftime. Sky Blue eventually won the match 5–4. At the age of 23, Kerr sat atop the all-time NWSL goalscoring table.[60] Kerr won the NWSL Golden Boot and MVP award after finishing the 2017 season with a record-breaking 17 goals.[61]

                            On 18 January 2018, Kerr was traded to the Chicago Red Stars along with Nikki Stanton by the Sky Blue FC in a three-team trade with the Chicago Red Stars and Houston Dash.[62] She got off to a slow start in the 2018 season, not scoring until the eighth match of the season when she contributed to a 1–1 draw against North Carolina Courage.[63] In August, she was named as NWSL Player of the Month for the third time in her career as she scored five goals throughout the month of August which included two goals against Portland Thorns FC and Orlando Pride.[64] At the end of the 2018 season, Kerr scored 16 goals and won the Golden Boot for the second consecutive season, leading to her becoming the first player to win the NWSL Golden Boot more than once, and was elected into the NWSL Best XI as a forward.[65][66]
                            
                            At the end of the 2019 season, Kerr and the Chicago Red Stars made their first appearance in the NWSL Championship, losing 4–0 to North Carolina Courage.[67][68] Several days prior to the championship game, Kerr was named the 2019 NWSL MVP, the first, and currently only, NWSL player to ever receive the award twice.[69] Kerr also received, for the third year in a row, the NWSL Golden Boot, leading the league with 18 goals and five assists, despite missing some games over the summer to play with Australia in the World Cup.[69] Kerr was also named Player of the Year by the National Women's Soccer League Players Association, who presented their own awards for the first time.[70]

                            On 13 November 2019, WSL club Chelsea announced Kerr would be joining the club for the second half of the 2019–20 FA WSL season on a two-and-a-half year contract.[72][73] Kerr made her Chelsea debut against Reading on 5 January 2020[74] and scored her first goal two weeks later against Arsenal.[75] She won her first trophy with Chelsea in their 2–1 win over Arsenal in the League Cup Final. Chelsea went on to win the 2019–20 league title despite a curtailed season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, based on a points-per-match basis.

                            During the 2021–22 WSL season, Kerr continued exhibiting fine form and was nominated for the Barclays Player of the Month for September. On 16 November 2021, Kerr signed a two-year contract extension, keeping her at the club until the end of the 2023–24 season, saying: "I can't see myself going anywhere else in the world or leaving Europe, having what I have at Chelsea."[80] The following week, Kerr scored the winning goal in Chelsea's Champions League group stage match against Servette, and scored her third league hat-trick, against Birmingham City, within 26 minutes, as well as providing the assist for team-mate Fran Kirby's 100th Chelsea goal, with Kerr celebrating her achievement with her signature back-flip, the first time she performed it at Chelsea's homeground of Kingsmeadow.[81] On 5 December, Kerr scored a brace in the delayed FA Cup final against Arsenal, winning Player of the Match, and helping her team lift the trophy and secure the domestic quadruple of the 2020–21 season, the first English women's club to achieve the feat.[82] Kerr ended the 2021 calendar year as the leading goalscorer in the WSL, with 23 goals, and was second in total assists with 10, behind Kirby.

She scored the lone Chelsea goal in a 3–1 defeat at the hands of Manchester City in the League Cup final and in Chelsea's 0–9 record-breaking win against Leicester City in the WSL on 27 March, Kerr scored a brace, repeating the feat the following week in a match against Reading, the 5th consecutive WSL match she had scored in.[83] On 24 April, in a league game against Tottenham Hotspur, Kerr scored in her 6th consecutive WSL match, and in doing so, broke her own record set the previous season of scoring against the most opposing teams, by scoring against all opponents bar Arsenal.[84] In April 2022, Kerr was awarded the FWA Women's Footballer of the Year, receiving 40% of the vote ahead of Vivianne Miedema and Lauren Hemp, and won the FA WSL April Player of the Month.[13] Kerr ended the season with 32 goals (including 3 goals of the 2020–21 FA Cup held over the course of the 2021–22 season) and 9 assists across all competitions, winning the Women's Super League for the third consecutive time, and the FA Women's Cup for the second consecutive time.[85] After a formidable season in front of goal for the Blues, she was voted Chelsea Women's Player of the Year[86] by Chelsea supporters with over 70 per cent of the vote and was also voted Women's Super League Player of the Season. She also received the PFA Players' Player of the Year,[87] in addition to being named in the PFA WSL Team of the Year for second consecutive year.[88] Kerr finished as top goal scorer, netting 32 times in all competitions.
